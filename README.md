Coursera-SQL for Data Science-Yelp Dataset SQL Lookup-Final Project

The dataset used is from a US-based organization called Yelp, which provides a platform for users to provide reviews and rate their interactions with a variety of organizations â€“ businesses, restaurants, health clubs, hospitals, local governmental offices, charitable organizations, etc. Yelp has made a portion of this data available for personal, educational, and academic purposes.


Part 1: Yelp Dataset Profiling and Understanding

I did data profiling to help profile and better understand the data in the first part of the assignment.
1. check count of values in each column
2. total distinct records by primary/foreign key 
3. checking for null values 
5. provided answers to the series of questions regarding the data

Part 2: Inferences and Analysis

In the second part, I have done my own analysis for the dataset where I have analysed which is the more successful category of business based on the no. of companies, reviews and star rating.

I have referred to the ER Diagram for more detailed information on the dataset.

SQL Queries used: COUNT, COUNT DISTINCT, SUBQUERIES, WHERE CLAUSE, AND, OR, MIN, MAX, AVG, AS, SUM, GROUP BY, HAVING, ORDER BY, LIMIT, LIKE %, ORDER BY DESC, INNER JOIN, ALIASES.

Kindly,refer to the attached file for the SQL codes and analysis.
